File Organizer Script

This Python script automatically organizes files in a specified directory into their respective folders based on file type. It is designed for personal use to tidy up files like pictures, videos, documents, and music.

Features

Moves image files (.png, .webp, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif) to the Pictures folder.

Moves video files (.mp4, .mov, .mkv) to the Videos folder.

Moves document files (.pdf, .docx) to the Documents folder.

Moves audio files (.mp3, .wav) to the Music folder.

Automatically scans all subfolders in the specified root directory.

Prints the names of files being moved.

Handles errors gracefully and continues processing other files.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Standard libraries only (os, shutil)

No additional installation is required.


Usage

Update the file paths in the script according to your system:

pictures = r"C:\Users\Olive\Pictures"
videos = r"C:\Users\Olive\Videos"
documents = r"C:\Users\Olive\Documents"
music = r"C:\Users\Olive\Music"
root = r"C:\Users\Olive"


Optionally, change the root variable to any folder you want to organize.

Run the script:

python file_organizer.py


The script will move the files to the corresponding folders and print the moved filesâ€™ names.

Notes

Only files with the specified extensions will be moved.

Files with unsupported extensions will be ignored.

The script will not overwrite files with the same name in the destination folder. You may need to handle duplicates manually if necessary.

Make sure the destination folders exist before running the script.
